# How the image is parse, in order to get the colors:
#  * full       - Read and return the whole image pixels more precision slower
#  * resized    - Resizes the image before parsing mantaining it s aspect ratio
#  * wal        - Uses image magick convert to generate the colors like pywal
#  * thumb      - Faster algo hardcoded to x no ratio respected
#  * fastresize - A much faster resize algo that uses SIMD For some reason it fails on
#                  some images where resized doesn t for this reason it doesn t replace
#                  but rather it s a new option
#  * kmeans     - Kmeans is an algo that divides and picks pixels all around the image
#                  Requires more tweaking and more in depth testing but for the most part
#                  it just werks

# What color space to use to produce and select the most prominent colors:
#  * lab      - Uses Cie L a b color space
#  * labmixed - Variant of lab that mixes the colors gathered if not enough colors it
#                fallbacks to usual lab not recommended in small images
#  * labfast  - Variant of lab that avoids floating arithmetic thus faster operations but
#                not that much precise result Images that work on lab labmixed could not
#                have enough colors for labfast

# Difference between similar colors, used by the colorspace:
#  1          Not perceptible by human eyes.
#  1 - 2      Perceptible through close observation.
#  2 - 10     Perceptible at a glance.
#  11 - 49    Colors are more similar than opposite
#  100        Colors are exact opposite
threshold = 10

# NOTE: All palettes will fill 16 colors (from color0 to color15), 16 color
#       variations are the 'ilusion' of more colors by opaquing color1 to color5.
# Use the most prominent colors in a way that makes sense, a scheme:
#  * dark            - dark colors dark background and light contrast
#  * dark16          - Same as dark but uses the colors trick
#  * darkcomp        - This is a dark variant that changes all colors to it s
#                       complementary counterpart giving the feeling of a new palette but
#                       that still makes sense with the image provided
#  * darkcomp16      - variation of the dark complementary variant
#  * harddark        - Same as dark with hard hue colors
#  * harddark16      - Harddark with color variation
#  * harddarkcomp    - complementary colors variation of harddark scheme
#  * harddarkcomp16  - complementary colors variation of harddark scheme
#  * light           - Light bg dark fg
#  * light16         - Same as light but uses the color trick
#  * lightcomp       - complementary colors variation of light
#  * lightcomp16     - complementary colors variation of light with the color variation
#  * softdark        - Variant of softlight uses the lightest colors and a dark background
#                       could be interpreted as dark inversed
#  * softdark16      - softdark with color variation
#  * softdarkcomp    - complementary variation for softdark
#  * softdarkcomp16  - complementary variation for softdark with the color variation
#  * softlight       - Light with soft pastel colors counterpart of harddark
#  * softlight16     - softlight with color variation
#  * softlightcomp   - softlight with complementary colors
#  * softlightcomp16 - softlight with complementary colors with colors

# This field chooses a method to use when the gathered colors aren't enough:
#  * interpolation - (default) Tries to pick two colors and built gradients over them
#  * complementary - Uses the complementary colors of two colors, or more (if needed), colors.

#  var.strip:  Output the color in `hex` (without a `#`).
#  var.red:    Output the red value.
#  var.green:  Output the green value.
#  var.blue:   Output the blue value.
